## Vauge Explanation for Beginners With External Proxies and Hosting
You will first want to host your proxies locally or externally. 
Somes good hosting options (both free and paid):
- <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a> (Free)
- <a href="https://nodeclusters.com">NodeClusters</a> (Paid)
- <a href="https://glitch.com">Glitch</a> (Free)
- <a href="https://repl.it">Repl.it</a> (Free)
- <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Azure</a> (Free and Paid)

Out of the list of hosting providers Heroku and NodeClusters rank first as a preference. You may also self-host. 

After you have selected a decent VPS, use Cloudflare for the DNS records for both the site and the subdomains for the proxies.

This is an example of DNS records involving Heroku. Self-hosting will require `A records` preferably.
